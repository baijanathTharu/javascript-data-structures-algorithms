# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counter

- It uses objects or sets to collect frequencies of values.
- Helps to avoid the need for the nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays and strings.

### Example:

- _Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be same._
