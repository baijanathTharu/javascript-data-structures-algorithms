# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counter Pattern

- It uses objects or sets to collect frequencies of values.
- Helps to avoid the need for the nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays and strings.

### Example:

- _Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be same._

- Anagrams: _Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman._

## Multiple Pointer Pattern

- In this pattern, we create pointers or values that corresponds to an index or position.
- This pointer can move towards beginning, end or middle depending on certain condition.
- Useful for problems that require minimal space complexity.

### Example:

- _Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist._

- _Implement a function called countUniqueValues which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array, but will always be sorted._
