# Problem Solving Approach

## Algorithm

- A process or set of steps to complete particular task.
- E.g. finding first 100 prime numbers

- It is the basic for problem solving.

## Strategies

- Understand the problem
- Make a plan for solving problems.
- Learn common problems and their solving patterns.
- Break down the problem into smaller pieces
- Solve the smaller pieces
- Refactor

### Understanding Problem

- Restate the problem in your own words.
- What are the inputs to the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
- Are the informations given in the problem sufficient enough to arrive at a solution?
- Labelling the important pieces of data in the problem.

### Concrete Examples

- Find simple examples
- Progress towards some complex examples
- Examples with no inputs
- Examples with invalid inputs

### Break into Smaller Pieces

- Writing steps that is to be taken to solve the problem.
